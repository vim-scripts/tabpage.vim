         This script is very simple, just beautify the default tab page,  this works on GVIM.
         See screenshots: http://vimer.1063083.n5.nabble.com/GVIM-tabpage-beautify-td4737356.html

         1.  Remove the path, only show filename.

         2.  Add number to each tab page

         3.  If buffer has been modified, add * to the title.
             
         4.  Limit the width of tab pages
             All tab pages have the same width, except that who's name is very long.

         5.  Add the line:   
              set showtabline = 2      " Allways show the tab page 
              to your vimrc file. Or just uncomment it from the tabpage.vim.
